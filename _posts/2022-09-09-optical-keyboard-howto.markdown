As of this writing there are no resources available that will walk you through building an
optical keyboard. Hopefully, this guide will give you an understanding of the
variables and tradeoffs. You will also make less mistakes if you follow the testing
tips. I hope to remove the mystery so you can focus on the fun part.

[Optical switches][optical-switch-makers] use a combination of infra-red emitter (IR) and a
phototransistor (PT) facing each other. When the switch is pressed a
plunger blocks the IR light from striking the PT causing voltage across
its collector-emitter junction to change.

Unlike mechanical switches, optical switches do not have copper contacts that rub
against the plastic shaft. Since there is no resistance caused by rubbing,
optical switches are extremely smooth. They can be used with low tension
springs (15g weight), while a mechanical switch will not pop up reliably under this
low spring force. Secondly, optical switches respond quicker than mechanical
switches since there is no debounce delay. Scan rate of matrix can be as high
as the USB (HS) polling rate. This could help in gaming applications. 

The fly in the ointment is that optical switches are not suitable for
handwiring (although possible with a [single-switch pcb][optical-amoeba]).
However, it has become affordable to get pcb's made and SMD components assembled
in China. For instance, [jlcpcb][jlcpcb] charges for only 2 pcb's for SMD
assembly if you choose green FR4. [KiCad][kicad-org] has also matured, with
decent [scripting support]({% post_url

an optical keyboard pcb from scratch and getting a few prototypes made is an
attractive proposition DIY projects.

## Circuit

Phototransistors are transistors with the base terminal exposed, where photons
impinging on the device activate the transistor. They can be used in either
active mode or in switch mode. In active mode, the transistor is an analog
element with a linear output that is proportional to the intensity of the
light. In switch mode the transistor acts as a digital element, and is either
in a cutoff (off) or a saturated (on) state.

There are two ways you can measure voltage drop across PT. The circuit shown in
Figure (A) is a common-emitter amplifier, with IR shown on left and PT on the
right. Light input at the base causes the output (**Vout**) to decrease from high
to low. If you were to connect **Vout** to the input pin of MCU it would read LOW to
HIGH when switch is depressed. The circuit shown in Figure (B) is a
common-collector amplifier with an output (**Vout**) increasing from low to
high in response to light input. In this case MCU pin will read HIGH to LOW.
For these circuits to operate in the switching mode, **Vcc** < **RL** Ã— **Ic**,
where **Ic** is the maximum anticipated 10 current and **Vcc** is the supply
voltage.

*What are the values of **R** and **RL**?*

The goal is to design a circuit that delivers the expected performance (scan rate) using minimum power.
To achieve this we have understand the relationship between sensitivity and rise time of PT.
Sensitivity is a measure of how efficient the device is at converting photons into current flow, and
how efficiently that current flow accomplishes switching. Higher value of
**RL** result in smaller current flow through PT, and so it takes less light to
switch it (more sensitive).
Rise time is the time taken for voltage across PT to cross a specified lower voltage
threshold followed by a upper voltage threshold, after IR light is incident on
PT. Fall time is defined as the reverse. The threshold values are determined by
[TTL voltage levels](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logic-levels/all).
MCU input pin will read a signal as LOW if volatge is less than 0.8v and read
as HIGH if it is higher than 2v. It is important to note that higher values of
**RL** result in higher rise time.

### Test Setup

You need an IR and PT that can be connected to a breadboard. You can get [single-switch pcb]() made or [solder the wires directly]().
You also need a MCU that runs Arduino (preferably), a multimeter and an optical switch.




The steps to determine values for **R** and **RL** are as follows: First, decide on
the matrix scan frequency and calculate the rise time (more on this later). Second, 
start with a trial value of **R** that results in a few mA of current at
IR, adjust **RL** such that the LOW value (when switch is not pressed) is below 0.8v and then check if the
switch works. Keep reducing the rise time until the switch no longer works.
Keep reducing the value of **R** (and corresponding value of **RL**) until you get the desired rise time.
These values are highly dependent on the size of packaging, wavelength and the view angle.

You need a simple test setup to 
Power consumed by PT is many orders of magnitude less than IR since we are using PT as a switch.
Value of **R** determines the current flowing through IR and eventually the power consumption.



The resistance values of **R** and **RL** depend on the scan rate of the
keyboard matrix, circuit type chosen for the matrix, and the type of IR and PT
pair.

Phototransistors have excellent sensitivity; a photon absorbed at the junction
creates a corresponding electron-hole pair. But it takes a lot of electrons for
the current to be noticed above thermal noise. The more IR light that falls on
PT, the higher will be the collector current (**Ic**) and lower will be the switching time. 

Reducing **R** will increase current (**I**) flowing through IR. But the value of load
resistance (**RL**) has to be matched with **R** for PT to work as a switch. Higher the value
of **RL** higher will be sensitivity of PT. The smaller the current flowing through
phototransistor, the less light it takes to switch it. For any value of **R**
(within the working range) there is a corresponding value of **RL** below which
the PT is not sensitive enough. Below the threshold value of **RL**, the GPIO pin 
will not register anything as you press the switch, or the pin may register
random values not unlike a floating pin. Here are some sample
values:

For **3.3v**:

|  **R**  |  **I**  |  **RL** (threshold) |  **Ic** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 540 | 4.2 mA | 4k | 0.83 mA |
| 680 | 3.2 mA | 5k | 0.66 mA |
| 1k | 2.1 mA | 15k | 0.22 mA |
| 1.5k | 1.4 mA | 27k | 0.18 mA |
| 2.2k | 1.0 mA | 45k | 0.1 mA |

* Voltage across **R** is ~2.14V
* **I** = 2.14/**R**, and **Ic** ~ 3.3/**RL**
* To get reliable switching use **RL** at least >20% above threshold value
* **R** and **RL** are in ohms

Switching can be accomplished at low currents (~1 mA at IR and 0.2 mA at PT) reliably as long as you
keep **RL** high. IR maybe rated at 20 mA but such high current is generally wasteful.
By supplying low current to IR, a single GPIO "Output" pin can drive a row of
15 switches in a typical keyboard. STM32 based MCU can supply up to 20 mA per GPIO
pin. RP2020 can provide up to 17 mA per GPIO pin.

Typical rise time of PT is about 15 us at 1 mA current. This is the minimum
amount of time you have to wait after activating IR ("Output" GPIO pin going HIGH) and before taking reading
at the "Input" GPIO pin. At low current (**Ic**) switching time will be
slightly longer, but not by much (20 us can work).

## Optical Matrix

The total number of switches in a full-sized keyboard far exceed the number of GPIO pins available in a MCU. A solution
to this problem is to connect switches in a matrix. Optical matrix is not much different from matrix used
for mechanical switches. You either select a column and read rows one by one, or *vice versa*.

The above circuit cannot be directly applied to a matrix. If you connect **Vcc**
(above) to a GPIO pin (set as "Output") it will not work when there are 
additional switches also connected this way. When you depress one switch, current from that PT will be
redirected to another switch's IR. So the GPIO pin (set as "Input") will not
register any change in voltage. You could use diodes to solve this problem, but
even fast diodes (like 1N4148) will interfere with the rise time of PT and
affect scan rate (will be <70 Hz). The solution is to split the power source of IR and PT; have IR driven
by GPIO pin and PT driven separately (from USB through voltage regulator or from 3v3/5v pin of breakout board).


### Select Column and Read Rows

In this arrangement we select a column (change column pin output to "High" and
wait for PT to "rise"), and read row pins one by one. After we are done,
change column pin output back to "Low" and proceed to the next column pin.
Reading time is usually negligible compared to PT rise time.
A full matrix scan will take approximately `rise_time x number_of_columns`. For 15 column
keyboard and 20 us wait time the matrix scan rate will be 3.33 kHz.

### Select Row and Read Columns

In this arrangement we select a row and read column pins one by one.
A full matrix scan will take `rise_time x number_of_rows`. This arrangement will produce higher scan rate.
For a 5 row keyboard scan rate will be 10 khz.

USB 1.1 supports 1 ms polling (1 kHz) while USB 2 supports up to 8 kHz. Since
these polling packets are small, data transfer rate limitation does not apply.
In summary, you can have a *very quick* keyboard.
