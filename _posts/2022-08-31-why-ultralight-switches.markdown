If you think mechanical keyboards are more comfortable to type, you should try
ultralight switches. Mechanical switches have a steel spring
inside them that is easily replaceable (assuming your switches are not
soldered to keyboard). Switches are available in varying actuation force 
ranging from 35g to 80g. Kailh Choc switches are even available in 25g force.
Ultralight switches have 15g or less of starting actuation force (preferred by stenographers).
These springs have to be purchased separately. Only linear switches (not the clicky
and tactile ones) are suitable for ultralight springs. If you are serious typist
or a programmer, ultralight switches are the best known remedy to ward off the onset
of RSI (repetitive stress injury).

Humans are not adapted to type many hours a day for years and decades. Evolution
has not equipped us since we have never done anything similar to typing in the jungle.
In fact, it is a miracle if someone who types six to eight hours a 
day for years does not experience some form of repetitive injury in the hands.
The root cause of finger pain is not the movement of finger itself, but the
repeated impact of heavy keyboard switches, especially clicky ones. Pressing
those 80g switches over thousands of times a day will accumulate injury over time.
We can only hope the one day we can wave hands in the air and some VR device 
translates the movement into text on the screen.

Finally, I am skeptical of ortholinear, split and curved keyboards. They simply
shorten the movement of fingers in the air. Often the benefit experienced by 
users who switch from membrane keyboards can be attributed to mechanical switches
that ortholinear keyboards have. Split keyboard marketers make a bogus claim 
that normal keyboards [constrict the hands](https://kinesis-ergo.com/split-keyboards/)
and cause ulnar deviation of the wrist (where hands are turned sideways at the wrist to 
align with he direction of the keys). Regular typists generally don't do that in my
observation; instead they keep the hands straight and reach the keys while hovering
their hands over the keyboard. There is plenty to learn from ergonomic experts
when it comes to wrist and hand positioning but the bottom line seems to be this: the root
cause of RSI is the repeated micro-impact from heavy switches.
