in the file index.md, when you specify layout: xxx, look
for xxx.md file in _layouts. I copied these files from
    various themes. You can edit them.
look at theme directory for _layouts, _includes etc.
good explanation at https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme

if theme has index.html or index.md you may not need one.
    if you have one make sure it matches theirs

_config.yml file contains theme selection, plugins and their
customization. these plugin variables are used in files 
under _layouts and _includes/
