If you think mechanical keyboards are more comfortable to type, you should try
ultralight switches. Mechanical switches have a steel spring
inside them that is easily replaceable (assuming your switches are not
soldered to keyboard). Switches are available in varying actuation force 
ranging from 35g to 80g. Kailh Choc switches are even available in 25g force.
Ultralight switches have 15g or less of starting actuation force ("steno" weight).
These springs are suitable only for optical switches since mechanical switches
have too much scratchiness (uneven resistance) that prevent keycap from
bouncing back reliably. Linear switches are to be preferred even though
clicky and tactile ones also work. If you are serious typist
or a programmer, ultralight switches are the best known remedy to ward off the onset
of RSI (repetitive stress injury). 

Humans are not adapted to type many hours a day year after year. Evolution
has not equipped us for typing activity since our ancestors have never done anything similar in the jungle.
In fact, it is a miracle if someone who types six to eight hours a 
day for years does not experience some form of repetitive injury in the hands.
The root cause of finger pain is not the movement of finger itself but the
repeated impact of heavy keyboard switches, especially clicky ones. Pressing
60g switches over thousands of times a day will accumulate injury over time.
We can only hope the one day we can wave hands in the air and some VR device 
translates the movement into text on the screen.

One issue with ultralight switches is that it is easy to mistype as keys adjacent to 
intended keys can get pressed. For spring forces below 15g (~15cn) it takes very little
force to activate a switch. We are not usually aware that when we are using one finger to press 
a key the adjacent finger also moves a little. Problem gets worse for switches like Gateron Yellow
Optical (so called "speed" switches) that have barely any pre-travel before activation (<1 mm in
practice). Kailh Box Optical switches are better in this regard.
